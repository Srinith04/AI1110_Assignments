\section*{Q4 (b)}

    If the straight lines $3x - 5y = 7$ and $4x + a y + 9 = 0$ are perpendicular to one another , find the value of $a$.
    
\section*{Solution}

    Given,\\
    The pair of lines $3x - 5y = 7$ and $4x + a y + 9 = 0$ are perpendicular to 
    one another.\\
    Slope of any line of form $ax + by + c = 0$ is $\displaystyle\frac{-a}{b}$\\
    $\Rightarrow$Slope of line $3x - 5y = 7$ = $\displaystyle\frac{3}{5}$\\
    $\Rightarrow$Slope of line $4x + a y + 9 = 0$ = $\displaystyle\frac{-4}{a}$\\
    Since the two lines are perpendicular the product of their
    slopes should be -1.\\
    So,
    $$\frac{3}{5} . \frac{-4}{a} = -1$$
    $\Rightarrow 5a = 12 $\\
    $\Rightarrow a = \frac{12}{5} $\\
    So,
    
    The value of $a$ such that the given two lines are perpendicular is:\\
    $\displaystyle\frac{12}{5}$ or 2.4
